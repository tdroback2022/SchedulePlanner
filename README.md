What to do:
(in console): make

(in console): ./test

this will clear the current events.txt file 

(in console): make a.out

(in console): ~/serve.py

With the app now open (Preferrably in a half screen and not in responsive mode because it causes some issues with double-clicks)
1: Create a daily schedule (leftmost menu icon) for the current day, tomorrow, and the next day. Hit the "Save" button when done with the daily schedule.

1a: If you want, you can also add a class (limit 15 characters) with a start and end time, then hit the "Add a class" button

1b: When using the pickers, a rapid-click on the desired selection may create a double-click event, so either use the arrow keys and enter to select an option or do a longer click press.

2: Create an event ("+" menu icon) of event type "Event" with a title, start day, repeats, start time, end time, and description. Click the "Create event" button to create this event

2a: When using the pickers, a rapid-click on the desired selection may create a double-click event, so either use the arrow keys and enter to select an option or do a longer click press.

3: Create a homework or exam event whenever you want to with a due date instead of repeat. "On" represents the day you want to start working on something (study or work on homework).

4: Go home (middle menu icon) and see your current day's events (left side), what's up next in your day (bottom right), and hourly percentage for each event type (top right)

5: Go to the expanded output (the rightmost menu icon) to see a general overview of all the events you have created for the upcoming 7 days

6 (optional): Overwrite one of your daily schedules by creating a new schedule on the same day as an old one and see the change in the home page / expanded output

7 (optional): Click on the star icon menu and today's date will be changed to tell you that you have big brain smarts. Click on home to undo this change
